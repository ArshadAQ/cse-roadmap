# CSE Roadmap
This was the prototye that we built at the **Hello-Web-Hackathon** conducted by **Mozilla** at our University.

The theme was "To Teach the Web/Help the society"

**The problem:**

- Students often find it difficult in deciding their area of specialisation.
- This is mostly true for the 1st year, 2nd year students who have very little/no clue of the path to take.

**The solution(idea) that we came up with:**

  - Make the user answer a set of questions each of which is inclined to a specific specialisation in Computer Science.
  - Use a weightage based model to decide on the score of each specialisation for the user.
  - Then, make the user select a specialisation on his own from the bouqet of courses presented in front of him.
  - Also, predict a specialisation for the user based upon the score he received and also upon the previous users' results.
  - This can be done by mapping the pattern of questions answered with the specialisation the user finally chose.
  
 Therfore, this model's prediciton accuracy increases with the increase in the number of users.
